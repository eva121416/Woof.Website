			  <h4>Our Colour Scheme</h4>
            
            
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
              
                
                <li>
				<p>The two shades of green represent sustainability and our connection with nature. Green evokes feelings of freshness, growth, and harmony with the environment.</p>	
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #DCE4B8;"></span>
					This light green gives the website a sense of lightness and freshness, and evokes a feeling of calmness, peace, and harmony with nature. It creates a pleasing background. </li>
					
				 <p><li><span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #2E4C17;"></span>
					This dark green is used for contrast, and emphasis. It adds sophistication, stability, and reliability.</li></p> 
				  
				<p><li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FFFAF2;"></span>
                  This off-white colour symbolizes responsibility, cleanliness, and simplicity. Off-white provides a clean and sophisticated look for our brand, reflecting our commitment to transparency and responsibility for the products we create.</li></p>
					
				 <p><li><span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #573616;"></span>
                  This brown is associated with nature and the earth, highlighting our commitment to sustainability, zero waste practices and love for nature.</li></p>
                
				 <p><li><span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FD6F2F;"></span>
                  Orange is positioned on the opposite to brown on the wheel of colors. It adds contrast and energy to our pallete. Orange represents positivity, playfulness, and friendliness, aligning with the vibrant and lively nature of dogs - thus the traits that the “pet parents” love about them (and our brand). It gives our brand a feeling of warmth and vitality. It will be used for key messages, calls to actions, and elements that the user should focus on. </li></p>
				  
				  <p>These colours together evoke a feeling of nature and health, which helps convey our values of high quality ingredients and full customization ability of dog food and treats, hence the perfect matching of products to optimise dog health.</p>
              </ul>
          
			  <h4>Logo Design</h4>
			  <p>The style of the line in our logo is intentionally free-flowing and dynamic to convey care-free spirit, and cheerfulness. It aims to evoke a sense of friendliness and playfulness. We wanted to give our logo and brand a feeling, often associated with running happily dogs (one of the reasons why dog parents love them) - spontaneity and "foolishness", highlighting the delight of a dirty but happy dog. Take a look here: <a href="corporate.html#logo">Logo</a></p>
			  
			  <h4>Typography</h4>
		    <p>Serif fonts for titles - This is strategically aligned with our brand's values and target audience preferences. Serif fonts convey a sense of reliability, authenticity, credibility, and trustworthiness, which resonates with millennials who prioritize scientifically proven actions and conduct thorough research before making purchases. By using serif fonts for titles, we aim to instill trust in our brand among millennials, emphasising our commitment to environmental responsibility and scientific research&nbsp;(Vlahos, 2023; Zain, 2023).</p>
			  
			<p>STIX Two Text - This is a distinct font that is great for titles. It demands attention without being overwhelming. See it <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/STIX+Two+Text?preview.text=This%20is%20a%20title&query=stix">here.</a></p>  
			<p>Poppins - This font has a very clear look. It is perfect for long body paragraphs, providing numbers and data. It is accessible as it is easy to read. Important text will be written in italics. See it <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.text=This%20is%20a%20title&query=poppins">here.</a></p> 
			 
			 <h4>Tone of Voice</h4> 
			<p>Our Tone of Voice is Semi-formal - Informative with the implementation of humor. It is playful.</p> 
			<p>Millenials’ ToV in communication and copywriting is direct, clever, and has a conversational style. Millennials love casual “write as I talk” copy, and they like to be straight to be point. This generation enjoys the implementation of memes, and popular cultural references, as well as the use of CAPS LOCK in social media posts, and emojis to express enthusiasm. Despite all this information, millenials can easily detect and reject copy/marketing attempts that feel pushy or inauthentic. Natural and genuine communication resonates the most with this demographic (Magalhães, n.d.).</p>  
			
          <h4>User Interface</h4>
			<h6>User interface patterns used:</h6>  
            <li><strong>Grids:</strong> Grant us the ability to organize our vision and values, video header and so on neatly while also maximising the screen space. This works well with our fonts to give the user a clear layout, as if allowing them space to breathe as they maneuver through our pages.</li>
			<li><strong>Containers:</strong> These are used to display our 4 values, the cards showing our products and our contact us form. All of these elements are rounded to give a playful and friendly feel, which is how we want to portray our brand.</li>  
			<li><strong>Carousel:</strong> Promotes user interaction by allowing them to click through our reviews. Makes the website more dynamic and playful which aligns with our brand personality and logo. This ties in with our marketing and communication strategy, where we want to convey our playful yet informative personality. The use of a carousel for this is to give the feeling that the reviews are never-ending, hence our brand is highly-accredited by our customers. </li> 
		    <li><strong>Top navigation bar:</strong> It provides a consistent and familiar navigation experience across our website. The drop-down menu allows for easy access to the multiple parts on the Shop page.</li>  
			<li><strong>Contact form:</strong> Enables the user to give us feedback and connect with us on a personal level. It is a structured interaction point that guides users through the contacting process by asking for their name, email, etc.</li>  
            <li><strong>Buttons:</strong> Allow our users to take our dog food/treat personalization quiz and purchase our products. This is a dynamic way to communicate our unique value proposal, which is that we give our customers the ability to fully customize the dog food and treats they can purchase from us.</li>
		  </ul>
			
			<ul>
			<h5>Structure of Main Page</h5></ul>
			<ul><p>In the Shop page (our Main page), we start with our navigation bar. This is with our off-white colour and Poppins font to give it a clean appearance. Beneath that, we chose a video header as opposed to an image header as it is more attention-grabbing. The video is of a dog to communicate that our brand is related to dogs and is for our target group - dog owners. The dog is wagging its tail which shows that it's happy, therefore implying that our brand will also make dogs happy. There is text over this video header that communicates our main feature and unique value proposal - the personalization of dog nutrition. We added a button for users to complete the quiz so they can immediately receive our service by pressing on it. Once the quiz is completed, the user is redirected to a product page of the product best for their dog. This is currently non-functional in the website but this is the idea of it. We then move into a part where users can shop our bestsellers, to give them an idea of what our products look like. For previous users, this is an easier way of purchasing a product they've previously purchased, without having to complete the quiz again. Then we move on to reviews, to boost our credibility as a brand. The contact form afterwards is to show customers that our brand is receptive to feedback and that we are open to forming a more personal connection with them. All of the titles are underlined with orange as this is our most eye-catching colour and grabs the user's attention while scrolling. </p>
			<h5>Structure of 'Why Woof?' Page</h5>
			<p>In the 'Why Woof?' page, we share our brand vision and values. This is done to advocate for ourselves as a brand and show people using our website why they should purchase from us. We start with a photo of a dog, to tie into our target group - dog owners. Then we state our vision, which has its own container on the page and it is in the center. This makes it feel like more of an important element, which encourages users to read it. It is underlined by a dark green to demand attention to it. Orange was not chosen for this as it is a less serious colour as compared to dark green, and for our vision we want to show that this section of our website is more serious. Additionally, the borders for the values below are orange and having the vision underlined in orange too would take away from this. The values below it are arranged in a zig-zag pattern to make this section more visually appealing. Every value is accompanied by an image that matches the copy, to communicate the values visually as well. The borders of the containers of the values are in our orange, as this contrasts well with the light green background and makes the values stand out.</p>
			<h5>Structure of 'Our Stores' Page</h5>
			<p>In the 'Our Stores' page, there is only an image banner, the same one as in 'Why Woof?'. This page was created so that all parts of the navigation bar were functional, however it was not developed as it is part of future devleopment.</p>

			  <h4>Our testing results:</h4>
              
                <h5>Positive aspects of the UI/UX design:</h5>
				<h6><strong>Good usability and intuitive navigation:</strong></h6>
                <li>After asking the testers to “purchase the “Carrot and Lamb” treats, they <strong>all</strong> scrolled to our bestsellers section of our website and clicked “Buy Now” under the correct jar.</li>
				<li>We asked testers to “find out what is the best food for your dog”. For <strong>five</strong> of them, it was clear that they had to go to our quiz, as they immediately did so. However, one of them went to the bestsellers/jars that we have on our website, read the descriptions, and made the choice that the “Beetroot and Lamb” treats were best for their dog, as their dog likes those flavours.</li>
				<li>When asked to reach out to us, <strong>five</strong> testers immediately scrolled down to the “Woof to us” section of our website, or clicked on this in the navigation bar, which told us that it was clear. One of the testers went to the “Corporate” page for this.</li>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h6><strong>Cohesive colour scheme and brand consistency:</strong></h6>
				<li>All <strong>six</strong> of our testers thought that the colours on our website matched the content. One of them mentioned that our colours give the vibe of healthy food with the green colours, and that the orange reminded the tester of carrots, which is one of our bestselling flavours, and is tied to our value of personalization as we are promoting healthier dog food and treats. Another tester said that our colours give a woody/outdoor feel, which matches the brand and our value of sustainable sourcing. Additionally, one of our testers mentioned that there is good consistency between the pictures that we use on our website.</li>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h5>Negative aspects of the UI/UX design:</h5>
				<h6><strong>Inconsistencies in the mobile version:</strong></h6>
				<li>All <strong>three</strong> of our mobile testers struggled to view the "Reviews" carousel on their phones. The carousel was not responsive for mobile and because it was so small, the words disappeared, therefore the reviews could not be read.</li>
				<li>The contact form was not optimized for mobile and was much longer in length than the phone screen. This made it difficult for the user to type and submit their feedback.</li>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<h6><strong>Flaws in product presentation</strong></h6>
				<li><strong>Two</strong> testers suggested displaying a wider variety of products, providing specific recommendations for each product type, and including more detailed information, such as nutritional facts.</li>
